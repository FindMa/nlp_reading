### Did Aristotle Use a Laptop? A Question Answering Benchmark with Implicit Reasoning Strategies

**论文小结**：在QA多步推理任务中，引入implicit decomposition(隐式的问题分解)，从而隐式地找到多步推理的路径。数据量略微有点小。

难点: 

* retrieving the context is difficult as there is little overlap between the question and its context
* questions tend to be short, lowering the possibility of the model exploiting shortcuts in the language of the question
